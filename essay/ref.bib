ABSTRACT="With the massive deployment of distributed energy resources, there has been
an increase in the number of end consumers that own photovoltaic panels and
storage systems. The optimal use of such storage when facing Time of Use
(ToU) prices is directly related to the quality of the load and generation
forecasts as well as the algorithm that controls the battery. The
sensitivity of such control to different forecasts techniques is studied in
this paper. It is shown that good and bad forecasts can result in losses in
particularly bad days. Nevertheless, it is observed that performing Model
Predictive Control with a simple forecast that is representative of the
pasts can be profitable under different price and battery scenarios.
We use real data from Pecan Street and ToU price levels with different
buying and selling price for the numerical experiments."

	abstract = {Abstract We present a computational framework that integrates forecasting, uncertainty quantification, and model predictive control (MPC) to benchmark the performance of deterministic and stochastic MPC. By means of a battery management case study, we illustrate how off-the-shelf deterministic MPC implementations can suffer significant losses in performance and constraint violations due to their inability to handle disturbances that cannot be adequately represented by mean (most likely) forecasts. We also show that adding constraint back-off terms can help ameliorate these issues but this approach is ad hoc and does not provide performance guarantees. Stochastic MPC provides a more systematic framework to handle these issues by directly capturing uncertainty descriptions of a wide range of disturbances.},
